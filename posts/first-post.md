Welcome to my first post for Next.js! I have created this blog site in order for me to track down my progress on learning and developing websites using React.js. I will also be using this site to give my thoughts on what I have found during my process of leanring React.js. \
Some examples would include solutions I have found, a web app that I am currently developing, or some problems I am having trouble. I will be updating some of the post where I have trouble or create a new one, depending how I would go on about my posting. Anyway, I am excited on about posting stuff in this blog about my progress! Thanks for reading!
