Hello! Happy New Year everyone! I have been working on importing some of react apps to the new one. I also took my time re-learning some of the stuff I learned while learning React.js for the sake of refresher \
The website currently uses Semantic UI as the CSS framework of the site. The apps currently features Calculator and To-do list only for now. I will add more apps as I continue learning React.js. \
Much of the content in the website are currently empty for now such as the homepage of the website. I will add some content later as I figure out the design of the apps. The website is currently deployed here: [Link](https://justyn-react-apps.netlify.app/)
