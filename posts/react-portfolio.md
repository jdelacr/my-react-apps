Hello everyone! I am announcing today that I have published my React Portfolio and it is currently live [here](https://jdelacr-portfolio.netlify.app/). The portfolio wasn't that great when I finished it and I was meaning to redesign it. The previous look of the portfolio was created by myself using SCSS. The final product was not the one I envisioned and the portfolio was seperated in different pages using React Router. \
I have now redesigned the portfolio where it is just a one page. The hardest part of rebuilding the portfolio was the design and the layout of the website. Originally, I wanted to have a theme of cherry blossom since I love them. In the end, I choose minimalism and choosed black and white. Of course that would be boring, so, I integrated a looped video as the header to make it unique. This time I used Semantic UI since I love the components it uses such as the divider. \
In the end, I have redesigned my React portfolio and I it will be featured in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janjustyn/).
